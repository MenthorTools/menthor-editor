* About RSyntaxTextArea

  RSyntaxTextArea is a syntax highlighting text component, written in Swing.
  It allows applications to easily embed syntax highlighting for most common
  programming languages.  Most other standard programmer's editor features are
  built-in: auto-indent, bracket matching, undo/redo, etc.  Auto-completion
  is available as an add-on library (see http://fifesoft.com/autocomplete).

* License

  RSyntaxTextArea is licensed under a modified BSD license.  Please see the
  included RSyntaxTextArea.License.txt file.

* Compiling

  If you wish to compile RSyntaxTextArea from source, the easiest way to do so
  is via the included Ant build script.  The default target builds the jar.
  
    cd RSyntaxTextArea
    ant
  
  Other targets are defined to build the source zip for the project, and
  generate its Javadoc.
