Hot to generate an executable JAR for Menthor. Follow the steps:

1. Change the attribute MENTHOR_VERSION in Main.java to point to the version you're building.
   ex: String MENTHOR_VERSION = "0.9.32";
   See more instructions close to the attribute

2. Change the attribute USE_LOG_FILE in Main.java to tell whether or not are you going to use the log file.
   In this case, change the attribute to true.
   ex: boolean USE_LOG_FILE = true;
   
3. Double click on Main.java, go to Export -> Runnable Jar. 
   Choose to package the libraries instead of extract them. Also,you do not need to generate a ANT build script.
   Rename the jar name to "menthor-"+MENTHOR_VERSION".jar, where MENTHOR_VERSION is your build version.

4. 	Select Library handling:
	Package required libraries into generated JAR
   
5. After generating the jar, open it with WinRAR/Unzip and delete the "swt.jar" files on the root of the jar, they are among the other libraries. 
   This is due to the fact that this swt.jar is specific of Winx64 platform and we used it only in the development process. We don't need it at runtime.
   
6. Double click on the jar file created or type in a console java -jar menthor-editor-+MENTHOR_VERSION+.jar to execute Menthor Editor application.
