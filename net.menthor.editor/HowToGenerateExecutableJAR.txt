Hot to generate an executable JAR for OLED. Follow the steps:

1. Change the attribute OLED_VERSION in Main.java to point to the version you're building.
   ex: String OLED_VERSION = "0.9.32";

2. Change the attribute OLED_COMPILATION_DATE in Main.java to point to the date where you are building the application
   ex: String OLED_COMPILATION_DATE = "Jul 01 2014"
   
3. Change the attribute USE_LOG_FILE in Main.java to tell whether or not are you going to use the log file.
   In this case, change the attribute to true.
   ex: boolean USE_LOG_FILE = true;
   
4. Double click on Main.java, go to Export -> Runnable Jar. 
   Choose to package the libraries instead of extract them. Also,you do not need to generate a ANT build script.
   Rename the jar name to "oled"+OLEd_VERSION_".jar, where OLED_VERSION is your build version.
   
5. After generating the jar, open it with WinRAR/Unzip and delete the swt.jar files on the root of the jar, they are among the other libraries. 
   This is due to the fact that this swt.jar is specific of Winx64 platform and we used it only in the development process. We don't need it at runtime.
   
6. Double click on the jar file created or type in a console java -jar oled+OLED_VERSION+.jar to execute OLED application.
