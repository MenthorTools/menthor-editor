How to run Menthor from the source code.
==============================================================

Requirements:
   - Eclipse Modeling Tools (Juno or superior recommended) with Maven installed.
   - Java 7
   - Git Client application (GitHub, Tortoise, Source Tree, etc)

-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Step 1. Import Menthor's source code into your machine/Eclipse

1.1 Checkout the source code from the github account using a Git Client application such as GitHub or Tortoise.
1.2 Open the Eclipse and choose your appropriate workspace (we recommend using the very same folder you checked out your code)
1.3 Go to File->Import->General->Existing Project into Workspace
1.4 Click in "Browse..." and choose the root folder where you can find all the source code you checked out
1.5 Select all the projects and click "Finish"

---------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2. Configure SWT according to your OS

By default all of our project point to the SWT library of windows x64. 
We need to change it to the version of SWT that matches with your operating system.
If you're using windows x64 chances are that we already use this version of SWT.

2.1 Go to the following projects (/antipattern, /pattern and /editor) and Right Click -> Build Path-> Configure Build Path for each of them.
2.2 In the "Libraries" tab search for the "swt.jar" file attached. Note that this library is probably that of winx64.
2.3 Remove the winx64 SWT entry and add the SWT that matches your operating system (Mac/Linux/Win and x86/x64). They are found in the folder /common/lib/
2.4 Add the new SWT entry for each of the aforementioned projects (/antipattern, /pattern and /editor)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3. Running Menthor

If your're using Mac you need to disable the "XstartOnFirstThread" option.

3.1 Go to Main.java file and Right Click -> Run As -> Run Configurations -> Arguments Tab
3.2 Click and disable the checkbox "XstartOnFirstThread".
3.4 To run the application go to Main.java -> Right Click -> Run As -> Java Application

==============================================================
How to generate Executable JAR
==============================================================

1. Change the attribute MENTHOR_VERSION in Main.java to point to the version you're building.
   Ex: String MENTHOR_VERSION = "0.9.32";
   See more instructions commented in that attribute

2. Change the attribute USE_LOG_FILE in Main.java to tell whether or not you're going to use the log file.
   In this case, change the attribute to true.
   ex: boolean USE_LOG_FILE = true;
   
3. Right click on Main.java, go to Export -> Runnable Jar.
   Rename the jar to "menthor-"+MENTHOR_VERSION".jar, where MENTHOR_VERSION is your build version.

4. 	Select Library handling at the checkbox: "Package required libraries into generated JAR"
    We need to choose to package the libraries instead of extract them. You do not need to generate an ANT build script also.
   
5. After generating the jar, open it with WinRAR/Unzip and delete the "swt.jar" files on the root of the jar, they are among the other libraries. 
   This swt.jar" is specific of Winx64 platform and we used it only in the development process. We don't need it at runtime.
   
6. Double click on the jar file created or type in a console java -jar menthor-editor-+MENTHOR_VERSION+.jar to execute Menthor Editor.
